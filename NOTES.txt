Seemoto queue engine

smtq

requirements:
+multiple named queues.
+queues have corelation string.
+there can be many producers and consumers for queue.
+only one message from queue-correlation processed at a time.
+messages come with timestamp
messages should be given to consumers ordered by the oldest
some queues require that queue-correlation process should be halted for n seconds if message is received. For ordering process in case messages ar out of order.

+messages should be given to consumers in backpressure subscribe fashion.
+persistent connection for high rquest per second count.
needs scalability over cores and machines.
needs message persistency. In case of process shutdown in memory data should be kept safe.
needs availability. one process or computer fail should not interfere with queue work.

deliver at least once


FIX: partitions are selected by name priority



Raw TCP server.
